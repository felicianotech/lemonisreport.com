As we gear up for the season 5 premiere of The Profit (only 7 days away), we thought it would be fun to go back to the last normal episode and do a recap. Enjoy.

On season 4, episode 18 of The Profit, Marcus heads to Waynesboro, Pennsylvania to meet with the owners of Zoe’s Chocolate. Zoe’s Chocolate is a family run Chocolate company with the father George as the Master Chocolatier and his three kids Zoe, Pantelis and Petros as the ones running the business.

When Marcus gets to the store and tries the chocolate, he immediately praises them for the taste and the unique flavors. Many of the flavors are a callback to the family’s Greek heritage. Marcus also remarks that they need more flavors and much more organization in the store if they wanted to be successful and profitable. His biggest issue with Zoe’s Chocolate is their lack of a story behind their product and more so their unwillingness to tell the story of their family as a way of creating a brand. The sibling’s pushback on telling that story is the biggest source of contention between Marcus and them.

The agreed upon deal for Zoe's Chocolate is $200,000 for 40% of the company, with the money specifically used to develop new products, create a new storefront, help the online store and to help create new partnerships in business. Of course this comes with the standard policy that Marcus is 100% in charge while he’s there.

In this episode Marcus uses Facebook Live to show the siblings how unorganized they are. Marcus streams a video on Facebook Live asking his 800,000 followers to place orders on the store website and the abnormally large number of orders completely throws the whole flow of the store out of whack. It’s always interesting to watch Marcus come up with new ways to help show small business owners ways they can improve and things they could work on.

This episode also sees a return of the guys from Flex Watches, a business Marcus invested in earlier in season 4. Since we've last seen them they have proved themselves to be extraordinary at marketing and branding, and are now involved with the web business of every company Marcus invests in. There’s an interesting parallel between the Flex Watch team and the Zoe's Chocolate family in that the Flex Watch team also shied away from telling the story of their product, but ultimately ended up embracing it, much Like Marcus hopes the siblings at Zoe's Chocolate will do. We should expect to see more of the Flex Watch team in the future as they are now a part of Marcus's web team.

Initially the siblings struggled to organize their store to Marcus's standard, so he brings them to Joe's Stone Crab, the second largest restaurant in the United States to give them an in person look at how an efficient and organized storeroom looks and operates. This serves as a wake-up call and leads to them fixing their back room to a standard even Marcus could approve of. All their progress leads to Marcus arraigning a pitch for Zoe's chocolate to potentially be part of all Norwegian Cruise Line ships around the world. The siblings use all they've learned from market in their pitch and leave with a handshake agreement and a test run on one Norwegian Cruise Line ship.

With the Zoe's Chocolate Family taking all of Marcus's lessons to heart, a remodeled store, a new logo, and revamped branding, this ends up being another success story for Marcus. Marcus ends up with another positive deal and can now add chocolate to his growing list of business endeavors.
