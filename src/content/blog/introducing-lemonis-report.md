Hello everyone. I am an extremely big fan of Marcus Lemonis and his show, The Profit. So much so that I wanted to create this website to have a central place to learn more about him, the show, and all of the businesses he's invested in.

## What to Expect From Us

**Blog Posts** - We're going to have posts:

- recapping new episodes with thoughts and fun facts thrown in
- interesting news related to Marcus or the show
- major news from any of Marcus's companies
- small business tips
- announcements related to this website

**Information** - We already have a database of every episode of The Profit with some basic information. Over time we'll add more information to this database to help us discover some interesting facts. We're also creating a database of Marcus's companies with tons of info including headquarters, number of locations, industry, etc.

**Meetup** - We have a local meetup in New York City for fans. You can read more [here](/meetup).

## The Goal

We're hoping to start as a fan site for "Lemon Heads" but grow into a community of small business owners (and those aiming to become one) who are open to change, modern business practices, and willing to learn and help others grow as well.

Thank you for stopping by. If you're interested, bookmark this site or follow us on social media (@LemonisReport).
