Marcus Lemonis is one of my heroes. I've met him on a couple of occasions and had the opportunity to hear him speak. A question I often hear asked is, "Do you have a family or wife?". His answer has always been the same. An explanation of the grueling reality of entrepreneurship, its hours, his travel schedule, and that having a family is simply not feasible.

**That was the saddest thing I've ever heard him say.**

Marcus is a great television personality and when I meet him in person, I quickly got the feeling that it was not an act. That he's genuinely a nice and caring person. As someone who's working towards being an entrepreneur, I want to be successful and impactful like Marcus, but I've always wanted a family. I think it's important to find that one special person, your soulmate. Marcus has been married previously but apparently that didn't work out. Things have changed.

It looks like Marcus has finally found the most important "partner" that he'll ever have, a woman named Bobbi Lemonis. Congratulations to you Mr. Lemonis. We, your fans, are happy to see that you've invested in yourself.
