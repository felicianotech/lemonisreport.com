title: "Lemonis Report Meetup"
---

Having a website to read about Marcus and his companies is nice. Discussing the show and business tips with other fans on social media is great. Meetup up with each other to watch an episode and share ideas, **that's best**.

We've made a meetup group for visitors of this site (Marcus and small business fans) who live in or near New York City. Events on Meetup.com would be for getting together to watch episodes of The Profit and possibly talks and workshops on small business where we can learn from experts and each other.

[Visit Lemonis Report NYC](https://www.meetup.com/LemonisReportNYC/).

Don't live near NYC? [Contact us](/contact/) and let us know where you live and that you'd like to see a meetup in your area. If we get enough requests for a particular location, we'll start a meetup there.
